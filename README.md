# Yazi plugins

My plugins for the [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) terminal file manager.

You can install them using the `ya pack` package manager introduced in Yazi v0.3.

Check specific installation commands and configuration instructions on each individual `README.md`:

## Jumping

- [first-non-directory.yazi](first-non-directory.yazi) - Allows easy jumping to the first file ignoring directories.

## Previewing

- [docx-preview.yazi](docx-preview.yazi) - Enable MS Word DOCX files in [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi).
- [doc-preview.yazi](doc-preview.yazi) - Enable MS Word (version 2, 6, 7, 97, 2000 and 2003) DOC files preview in [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi).

## [yatline.yazi](https://github.com/imsi32/yatline.yazi) addons

- [yatline-symlink.yazi](yatline-symlink.yazi) - Shows a symlink's target in your header or status line.

## Disclamers

:rotating_light: Note that `ya` is a newly introduced standalone CLI binary, not a shell alias for Yazi (See <https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/issues/914> for details)

If you don't have it, you can copy each directory (keeping the `.yazi` part) to your `~/.config/yazi/plugins` and manually keep them up to date.
