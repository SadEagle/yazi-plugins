# Yazi plugins

My plugins for the [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) terminal file manager.

You can install them using the `ya pack` package manager introduced in Yazi v0.3.

Check specific installation commands and configuration instructions on each individual `README.md`:

- [first-non-directory.yazi](first-non-directory.yazi) - Allows easy jumping to the first file ignoring directories.

:rotating_light: Note that `ya` is a newly introduced standalone CLI binary, not a shell alias for Yazi (See https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/issues/914 for details)

If you don't have it, you can copy each directory (keeping the `.yazi` part) to your `~/.config/yazi/plugins` and manually keep them up to date.
